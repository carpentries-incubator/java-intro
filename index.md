The Java programming language is a **class based**, **object-oriented** programming language. It was designed to be a general-purpose programming language intended to write once, run anywhere (WORA) which means that once written and compiled it should run on any platform that supports Java without the need for recompilation. A Java program requires the Java Virtual Machine to be installed. The syntax of the Java language is similar to that of C++.
