## Background

Programs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code (VSC) are referred to as IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). We don't need to use them but they do make our lives much easier. They offer features such as syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, code completion.

There are two types of programming languages, interpreters and compilers. Interpreters have an "engine" that is written for a specific platform (eg. Mac or PC) and a scripting language (eg. Python and Perl). 


### Starting a project with VSC

- Installation
    - Download
    - Install
- Create a workspace
    - Directory Structure
- Press Ctrl-Shift-P
- Select the directory where you want to save the project
- Call the project: `java-intro-program`. You can call it anything but for now stick to this so that we are all on the same page.
